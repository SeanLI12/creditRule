          </li>
          <li>
            Cryptocurrency bets can be processed and confirmed irrespective of
            price changes. This may be contrary to your “Odds Preference
            Setting”.
          </li>
          <li>

          <li>Settlement is based on time zone UTC +7.</li>
          <li>
            If any event disrupts the market, including the suspension of or
            limitation of prices being stated, the company may, in its absolute
